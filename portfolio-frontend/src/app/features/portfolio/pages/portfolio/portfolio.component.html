            The client portal is a Business to Business application, that shows Alpha's client data about their projects.
            In this project I have taken the role of <b>designer</b> and <b>front-end developer</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web application has been made using <b>Angular</b> and designed by myself using <b>Figma</b>.
            The application uses a <b>REST</b> api, that provides data from Alpha's databases.
            The data is then transformed on the front-end to create the format needed for charts and other widgets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project has allowed me to sharpen my <b>greenfield project</b> development and also sharpen my skills in <b>Angular</b>.
            Solidifing concepts like, storing local user data, state management, authentication, error handling, request handling and creating an expandable/reusable code base.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is currently <b>in use</b> by Alpha Clients.
